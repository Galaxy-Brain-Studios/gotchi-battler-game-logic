# Project Directory Structure

This rule documents the main directory structure of the project and highlights the purpose of important files and folders. Use this as a reference for navigation and for understanding where to place or find code and resources.

## Root Level

- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`: Node.js dependencies and scripts.
- `Dockerfile`, `cloudbuild.yaml`: Deployment and CI/CD configuration.
- `eslint.config.js`: Linting configuration.
- `index.js`: Entry point or root logic.
- `.gitignore`, `.DS_Store`: Git and system files.

## Main Folders

- `game-logic/`: Core game logic, organized by version (e.g., `v1.4`, `v1.5`, ..., `v2.0`). Each version contains:
  - `index.js`: Main logic for that version.
  - `constants.js`: Constants for that version.
  - `helpers.js`: Helper functions (in later versions).
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for running, validating, and simulating battles, as well as data and balancing tools.
  - `balancing/`: Scripts and data for balancing, with subfolders for different balancing versions (e.g., `v1.7`, `v1.7.1`, ...).
  - `data/`: JSON data for dungeons, teams, tournaments, etc.
  - `output/`: Output files from scripts.
  - Various JS scripts for running and validating battles and tournaments.
- `utils/`: Shared utility modules (e.g., `errors.js`, `transforms.js`, `mapGotchi.js`, `contracts.js`, `validations.js`).
- `schemas/`: JSON schemas (e.g., `team.json`).
- `constants/`: Shared constants (e.g., `tournamentManagerAbi.json`).
- `.cursor/`: Cursor rules and configuration.
  - `rules/`: All cursor rules (e.g., `cursor-rules.mdc`, `directory-structure.mdc`).

## Notes
- All source and configuration files should be placed in their appropriate folders as outlined above.
- Cursor rules must always be placed in `.cursor/rules/` following the naming and structure guidelines in `cursor-rules.mdc`.
